this is the read me for a project to make an auto filling dictionary of linked words in roam

design outline for roam word glossary

try to (things that appear possible from chrome extension docs)
detect if url is roam [done]
detect keystrokes from user [done]

if i can do those

add any word with [[]] around it to a dictionary(type thing) [working on / different approach maybe necessary]
search the dictionary of words for all future words (every keystroke? every space so it only fires at the end of the word?)

if it matches, inject the [[]] around the word (not sure if possible, but i think so)
